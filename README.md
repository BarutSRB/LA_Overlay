## Description
**LA_Overlay** is a standalone overlay designed specifically for *Lost Ark*. It operates independently of the game, ensuring no interaction with the game's memory or packet analysis, making it completely safe.

## Features
- ``Class Support:`` Currently only supports the Bard class with plans to expand to other classes.
- ``Skill Cooldowns:`` Tracks and displays skill cooldowns.
- ``Buff Uptime:`` Tracks and displays skill's buff uptime. Buffs are represented by a green bar below the skill's icon, which decreases over time.
- ``Audio and Visual Alerts:`` Provides an audio alert and flashes the buff skill icon in red 3 seconds before the expiration of Bard's Heavenly Tune and Sonic Vibration buffs to help prevent overlapping of buffs and ensure efficient rotation.
- ``Gauge Tracker:`` Shows class gauge bars. You might need to adjust it for your screen size. Right now, it only works for the Bard class at 3440x1440p flawlessly.
- ``Conviction Judgment:`` Detects when the Conviction Judgment buff is active and applies a 15% cooldown reduction to skills used during its duration.

## Future Plans 
(*When I have time and if not lazy*)
- ``Expanded Notifications:`` Include boss phases/mechanics change notifications with the exact phase/mech name based on the boss's HP bars, and notification for counters to allow players to position themselves and prepare to counter the boss.

## Motivation
The development of LA Overlay stemmed from the need for a more customizable and resolution scalable UI. It focuses on providing a minimal interface to easily monitor important buffs in the fast paced and visually busy environment of Legion Raids.

## Future Hope
The hope is that Smile Gate developers will stop being lazy and eventually either allow UI addons or implement more modern and customizable UI options.
